#' Allele frequencies from 402,430 single nucleotide polymorphisms
#'
#' The dataset “Human_Allele_Frequencies” is a 49 × 402,430 matrix 
#' that contains allele frequencies from 402,430 single nucleotide 
#' polymorphisms in Chromosomes 1-10 in 49 human populations. 
#' The last population “San” is intended to be used as an outgroup.
#' The allele frequencies have been compiled from ALFRED database 
#' at Yale University. The analysis from this dataset has been 
#' published in Peng et al 2021.
